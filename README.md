## Usage
Users/Patients first login (as a user role) to gain access to the application. The user begins constructing an appointment by choosing an appointment specialty. They are then redirected to a page showing the clinics and doctors that provide those specialties. The user then fills out a patient registration form to give the appointment more information and enter a new user into the database. The user reviews their inputted information and selection, then selects an appointment date and time. The user can lookup their appointment to review the information or cancel it.
